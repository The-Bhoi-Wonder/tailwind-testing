    <p>I&apos;m a recent computer science graduate from the University of South Carolina. I like to play soccer and I work as a server and bartender. I&apos;ve recently started to do some web development and I finally decided to deploy a website. My goal is to learn node.js while working on different kinds of little projects. 
 
 I plan to add more to the website over time so check back in every now and again to see what has changed.
  
 Current plans: photos from travelling, youtube(or similar) video embedding for a soccer video, and a nice UI to go with it
